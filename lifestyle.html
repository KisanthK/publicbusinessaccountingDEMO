            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">Well-being is measured by a "Happy Pleasant Life." 80% of people are morally rich. Money fills bank accounts, but it does not fill hearts and minds.</p>

            <h3>It's ours for a little while</h3>
            <p>Do not convince yourself that working harder for money is a higher priority than your duties to your family and society. Everyone is unique—comparing yourself to others only makes life miserable. Once you build your life and become materially rich, do not create artificial boundaries. Remember the relatives and friends who filled your heart when you had nothing.</p>
